			<p>The big draw for me attending NYU in New York was the ability to use their recording studio facilities, which are some of the finest for a university and finest in the world. The number of hours I have spent recording in them so far is easily in the triple digits and I hope to record countless more songs and sessions until I graduate.</p>
